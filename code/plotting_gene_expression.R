# WALKING THROUGH RSTUDIO:
# console
# global environment
# scripting space
# plot and help viewer

# Using R as a calculator
# addition  +
5 + 3
# subtraction -
5 - 3
# multiplication *
5 * 3
# division /
5 / 3

# mod (reminader) %%
5 %% 3

#exponent
5 ** 3
5 ^3

#combining terms together (PEMDAS)
5 - 3^2
(5-3) ^ 2

# VARIABLES:
weight_kg <- 55
weight_kg = 55

#print to console
weight_kg
print(weight_kg)

#weight in pounds
weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg

# READING DATA INTO R:

# To import the file, first we need to tell our computer where the file is.
# We do that by choosing a working directory, that is, a local directory on our
# computer containing the files we need. This is very important in R. If we forget
# this step weâ€™ll get an error message saying that the file does not exist. We
# can set the working directory using the function setwd.
# TODO: talk about Rproject instead
