# READING DATA INTO R: 

# To import the file, first we need to tell our computer where the file is. 
# We do that by choosing a working directory, that is, a local directory on our 
# computer containing the files we need. This is very important in R. If we forget 
# this step weâ€™ll get an error message saying that the file does not exist. We 
# can set the working directory using the function setwd.
